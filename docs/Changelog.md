# Changelog

All notable changes to Open Standard Library will be documented in this file.

## v1.0.2 — 2026-05-19

### Added
- **File encoding options** — Added `FileEncoding` enum (`UTF8`, `ASCII`, `Unicode`, `UTF32`) and `FileEncoding` property on `oWorkbook`. Delimited file export and import now use the configured encoding instead of hardcoded UTF-8. Does not affect ODS or XLSX, which require UTF-8 per their specifications
- **Dynamic version string** — Generator name and version are now derived from the assembly version at runtime, which is set automatically from the git tag during CI builds. Replaces hardcoded version strings in `oWorkbook` and ODS metadata
- **Header row detection** — Added `HasHeaderRow` property, `HeaderNames` computed property, and `GetColumn(string headerName)` method to `oSpreadsheet`. When `HasHeaderRow` is true, first-row values are exposed as column names and data cells can be retrieved by header name
- **Streaming CSV row reader** — Added `ReadCsvRowsAsync(Stream, bool hasHeaderRow, int? rowLimit)` to `Spreadsheet`. Reads rows one at a time via `IAsyncEnumerable<string[]>` without loading the entire file into memory. Supports optional header row consumption (stored in `CsvHeaders`) and row limit
- **DateTime and Int64 cell value types** — Added `CellValueType.DateTime` and `CellValueType.Int64`. DateTime values are stored as ISO 8601 strings and round-trip through both XLSX (OLE Automation serial dates with numFmt style) and ODS (`office:date-value` attribute). Int64 is exported as a numeric value in both formats. XLSX import detects date-formatted cells by reading styles.xml numFmtIds

### Fixed
- **CSV import quote-escaping bug** — Doubled quotes (`""`) are now correctly unescaped to single quotes (`"`) on CSV import per RFC-4180

---

## v1.0.1 — 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Auto-filters** — Added `SetAutoFilter()` and `SetAutoFilter(int startRow, int startCol, int endRow, int endCol)` to `oSpreadsheet`. XLSX emits `<autoFilter ref="..."/>`, ODS adds `<table:database-range>` with `display-filter-buttons="true"`. Full round-trip import/generate support for both formats
- **Tests** — Added auto-filter tests, bringing test count from 102 to 113

### Fixed
- **ODS files requiring repair in LibreOffice** — Fixed multiple issues preventing ODS files from opening cleanly: incorrect namespace on `table-column-properties`, invalid empty `number-columns-repeated` attribute, UTF-8 BOM in XML files, `standalone="yes"` in XML declarations, missing `settings.xml` entry in manifest, and mimetype entry not stored uncompressed as first ZIP entry

---

## v1.0.0 — 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Column width control** — Added `SetColumnWidth(int column, double width)` and `AutoFitColumns(double minWidth, double maxWidth)` to `oSpreadsheet`. XLSX uses `<cols><col>` elements, ODS generates per-column styles on `<table:table-column>`. Auto-fit uses a character-length heuristic with configurable min/max constraints
- **Freeze panes** — Added `FreezeRows` and `FreezeColumns` properties to `oSpreadsheet` with full generate/import support for both XLSX (`<pane>` element) and ODS (`settings.xml` config items)
- **Cell Styling API** — New `CellStyle` class on `oCell.Style` with support for bold, italic, underline, font color, background color, font name/size, and borders (thin/medium/thick with color per edge). Styles are deduplicated and written as dynamic `styles.xml` entries in XLSX and named automatic styles in ODS
- **Text wrapping** — Added `WrapText` property to `CellStyle`. XLSX emits `<alignment wrapText="1"/>` in styles.xml, ODS sets `fo:wrap-option="wrap"` on table-cell-properties
- **Boolean cell value type** — Added `CellValueType.Boolean` with full generate/import support for both XLSX (`t="b"`) and ODS (`office:boolean-value`). Values stored as `"true"`/`"false"` strings
- **Test project** — Added `OslSpreadsheet.Tests` with 102 xUnit tests covering workbook creation, sheet/cell operations, boolean values, cell styling, text wrapping, freeze panes, column widths, and round-trip generate/import for ODS, XLSX, and CSV formats
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions workflow to publish to NuGet on version tags
